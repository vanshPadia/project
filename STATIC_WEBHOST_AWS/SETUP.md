## üìã Prerequisites
Before starting the deployment, make sure you have:

- AWS account with proper permissions
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Jenkins server with the following plugins:
  - AWS CloudFormation
  - Credentials Binding
  - Pipeline
- Registered domain name (you can purchase one through Route 53 or another registrar)
- Basic knowledge of AWS services and CloudFormation

## üöÄ Detailed Setup Instructions

### üåê Environment Setup

1. **Configure AWS credentials in Jenkins**
   ```bash
   # Add AWS credentials to Jenkins credentials store
   # ID should be 'aws' as referenced in Jenkinsfile
   ```

2. **Set up Jenkins folder properties**
   Create a Jenkins folder with the following properties:
   - `environment`: dev or prod
   - `product`: your product name (e.g., impressico)
   - `service`: your service name (e.g., static-webapp)
   - `domainName`: your registered domain name
   - `subdomain`: subdomain for your site (e.g., www)

### üåê Domain Configuration

1. **Review DNS configuration**
   Examine `iac/aws/cloudformation/route_53/Route53-acm.yaml` to ensure it meets your requirements.

2. **Deploy the DNS and ACM stack**
   ```bash
   # Run the first stage of the Jenkins pipeline
   jenkins-cli run Pipelines/static_webapp/Jenkinsfile -s DeployDNSStack
   ```

3. **Verify ACM certificate**
   - Check that the certificate validation is complete
   - This may take some time as DNS validation occurs

### üóÑÔ∏è S3 and CloudFront Deployment

1. **Review CDN configuration**
   Check `iac/aws/cloudformation/s3/s3-cdn.yaml` for:
   - S3 bucket settings
   - CloudFront distribution configuration
   - Route 53 record settings

2. **Deploy the CDN stack**
   ```bash
   # Run the second stage of the Jenkins pipeline
   jenkins-cli run Pipelines/static_webapp/Jenkinsfile -s DeployCDNStack
   ```

3. **Verify deployment**
   - Confirm S3 bucket is created with proper policies
   - Check that CloudFront distribution is deployed (this may take 15-30 minutes)
   - Verify Route 53 records point to the CloudFront distribution

### üìÑ Content Deployment

1. **Customize the website content**
   Edit the `index.html` file in the project root to match your requirements.

2. **Deploy the content**
   ```bash
   # Run the content deployment stage
   jenkins-cli run Pipelines/static_webapp/Jenkinsfile -s DeployContent
   ```

3. **Verify website accessibility**
   - Open your browser and navigate to:
     ```
     https://subdomain.yourdomain.com
     ```
   - Also check the apex domain:
     ```
     https://yourdomain.com
     ```
